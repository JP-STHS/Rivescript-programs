+[*]turn around[*]
%*feel a sudden tap*
- \nYou turn around to see a goofy lookin fellow wearing sandals and a long black robe, his hair hidden by a large tin foil hat and his face donned by an RGB gaming mask. The strange man points towards the windows screaming, "THE FLOOD IS COMING!!!." Do you believe him?\nYes\nNo
+[*]yes[*]
%*you believe him*
- Your gut tells you to believe the weirdo and follow him. As soon as you accept the stranger's message, he hands you a letter before vanishing in a cloud of smoke. The other customers in the cafe give you the side-eye. Do you stay, or open the letter?
+[*]no[*]
%*you believe him*
- You assume the dude is crazy and continue to wait for your <get choice>. Unfortunately, the flood didn't wait for you. {@flooddeath}
+[*]stay[*]
%*or open the*
- Embarrassed by the encounter, you stay put. The flood doesn't though. {@flooddeath}
+[*]letter[*]
%*or open the*
-Although everyone is looking at you like you're nuts, you consider your life more important then their harsh glances. You quickly open the letter, and find an arrow pointing at the nearest pothole cover with an urgency symbol. Without thinking twice, you run outside and jump in the nearest pothole, closing the lid behind you. As you jump in, you hear the sounds of water gushing over the lid.\n\nYou survived the flood! {@survival} <set survivedflood = 1>

+[*]bullet[*]
w%*where the bullet*
- As the crowd panics, you look at the direction from which the bullet came from. It seems to you like it came from the nearby docks, yet looking out the window, you don't see anything suspicious. Just a couple of ducks.\n You hear the TV in the main dining area on full blast and decide to see what is happening. \nA crowd gathers around the television screen as an emergency broadcast appears: <a href="https://imageproxy.ifunny.co/resize:640x,quality:90x75/images/de14b2e84b81af9d7d2c261981dc724c39cfffb61b86861243eda3897362e15a_3.jpg">The broadcasted message</a> \n\n - Enter anything to continue -

%*the broadcasted message*
- Glancing outside, you notice the ducks by the docks again. This time though, you notice all the ducks armed with weaponry. It looks like they are done acting in secret. You notice a sword leaning next to the front door in the corner of your eye, but just across the street you see a bunker. You are given a choice:\n- Grab the sword\n- Go to the bunker
+[*]sword[*]
%*across the street*
-You grab the sword and charge at the ducks. You get a few good swings in but your sword shatters into pieces as the ducks use their advanced weaponry. You run to the bunker only to see that it has been sealed shut. You can:\n- Accept your fate\n- Fight to the death\n- Call for help.

%*has been sealed shut*
- You see the ducks closing in. You scream for help and feel a light tug on your shoe. You look down and notice a small hole you didn't see previously next to the entrance to the bunker. Without hesitation you dive inside. The moment your soles enter the hole, you hear explosions, battle cries, gunfire and quacks. After a while the noise quiets down.\n\nEnter anything to continue.

%*after a while the noise*
-You exit the hole and notice the building above you has been completely demolished, leaving only the small hole and bunker in-tact. You can hear a radio message being broadcasted that the ducks have been defeated. It looks like the government has taken care of the duck invasion. With relief, everyone around resumes life as if nothing happened.\n {@survival}\n\nYour survived the duck invasion! <set survivedducks = 1>

-\nHopping out of the sewers you notice everything and everyone around you soaking wet. Nobody seems to care though. Amidst the flooded buildings, the Cafe looks untouched. It seems like the cafe was used to flooding considering the sea was less than a mile away. You walk back into the cafe to grab your <get choice>, but you feel an urge to use the restroom. Looks like being in a sewage drain for an hour has done a number on you. You can either:\n- Use the toilet\n- Hold it in

The cashier, acting as if nothing happened, brings you your <get choice>. After all the events of today, you feel satisfied knowing you can finally have a <get choice>. \nAs you stretch out your hand to grab your order, the cashier stops you midway and utters three words you could have never anticipated, "Cash or Credit?"\n Realizing you forgot your wallet you have been given one final choice:\n- Go home\n- Don't pay
